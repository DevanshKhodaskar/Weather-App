This Weather Application is a Python-based project that provides real-time weather information for any city using the WeatherAPI service. It features a dynamic wallpaper that changes based on the time of day, with images for sunrise, daytime, sunset, and night. The application uses Tkinter to create an intuitive graphical interface, integrating `requests` for API calls and `pillow` for image handling. Users can easily access current temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index. This project offers a visually appealing, user-friendly way to monitor weather conditions while keeping the desktop environment interactive and responsive.



### Guide: Integrating the WeatherAPI in the Project

The Weather Application uses the `weatherapi.com` service to fetch real-time weather data. Follow these steps to set up and configure the API for this project:

#### Step 1: Register and Get an API Key
1. Visit the [WeatherAPI Website](https://www.weatherapi.com/).
2. Sign up for a free account and log in.
3. Navigate to your dashboard and generate an API key.

#### Step 2: Configure the API in the Project
1. Open the file `weatherAPI.py`.
2. Locate the line in the `weather(city)` function that reads:
   ```python
   data = requests.get(f"https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=/*YOUR API KEY*/&q={city}")
   ```
3. Replace `/*YOUR API KEY*/` with your actual API key:
   ```python
   data = requests.get(f"https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=YOUR_API_KEY&q={city}")
   ```

#### Step 3: Understand the API Call
- The API request URL includes:
  - **`key`**: Your unique API key.
  - **`q`**: The query parameter, representing the city name or coordinates.
- The API returns data in JSON format, which includes fields like:
  - `current.temp_c`: Current temperature in Celsius.
  - `current.wind_mph`: Wind speed in miles per hour.
  - `current.humidity`: Humidity percentage.
  - `current.uv`: UV index value.

#### Step 4: Handling the API Response
- The response is stored in `formatedData = data.json()`.
- Access required fields from `formatedData` and display or use them as needed in the application.

#### Troubleshooting
- **Invalid API Key**: Double-check the API key for any typographical errors.
- **City Not Found**: Ensure the city name is spelled correctly or use the cityâ€™s coordinates (latitude and longitude) for better accuracy.
- **API Limit Exceeded**: The free tier has limited calls; consider upgrading your plan if more requests are needed.

With these steps, you should have the WeatherAPI integrated into the project successfully!



### Required Libraries and Installation Commands

The Weather Application requires several Python libraries for API interaction, GUI development, and image processing. Below is a list of the libraries used in the project along with their installation commands:

1. **Requests**  
   - Used for making HTTP requests to interact with the WeatherAPI.
   - **Installation Command:**
     ```bash
     pip install requests
     ```

2. **Pyttsx3**  
   - Provides text-to-speech capabilities for voice-based weather updates (optional).
   - **Installation Command:**
     ```bash
     pip install pyttsx3
     ```

3. **Pillow (PIL)**  
   - Used for opening, manipulating, and displaying images (e.g., setting background images).
   - **Installation Command:**
     ```bash
     pip install pillow
     ```

4. **Tkinter**  
   - Built-in Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUI).
   - **Installation Command (Linux/Unix):**
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install python3-tk
     ```
   - For Windows, Tkinter is included by default in the Python installation.

5. **JSON**  
   - Built-in Python module for handling JSON data (used to parse API responses).
   - **No separate installation needed** as it is included in the Python standard library.

### Summary Installation Command
To install all the external dependencies at once, run:
```bash
pip install requests pyttsx3 pillow
```

This should set up the environment required to run the Weather Application smoothly!
